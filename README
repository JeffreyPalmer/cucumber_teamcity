== A basic Cucumber Formatter for TeamCity

Tested with {Cucumber}[http://github.com/aslakhellesoy/cucumber/tree] 0.2.3 and {TeamCity}[http://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/index.html] 4.0.2.
== Install

Just copy <tt>teamcity_formatter</tt> to <tt>features/support/</tt>

Then add <tt>-f TeamCityFormatter</tt> to your cucumber command-line. 

Right now, it seems that if you specify multiple formatters, cucumber will
not output the final one to stdout, so you may want to make sure this is
the only formatter used in your testing. (Alternatively, you could
write to <tt>/dev/stdout</tt> if your system supports that, but right now,
cucumber seems to not like that option.)

Terminology maps this way:

* Cucumber -> TeamCity
* Feature -> TestSuite
* Scenario -> Test
* Step -> No mapping, but steps will raise errors in the test

== Notes

I haven't tested this with Scenario Outlines, or a few other features,
so your output may vary. Please feel free to submit patches.
